                For most divers, scuba diving is a highly visual experience –
                you dive to see what’s under the water. So it comes as no surprise
                that a top-quality dive mask is an important part of every diver’s
                gear, or that manufacturers continue to come up with new and more
                innovative masks practically every year. There is a large selection
                of features and styles, all of which makes it possible for the diver
                to pick the most comfortable mask that provides the greatest visibility
                for their individual needs.

                Modern-day masks may be among the most distinctively styled and individualistic pieces of equipment that you’ll find in a dive center. Yet, as different as they may appear, all masks (even the old porthole-style “frogman” masks that you see in 1950s movies) do three basic things:
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                Masks add an air space between your eyes and the water. This is not only more comfortable; it is physically necessary on order for your eyes to see and focus properly. Your eyes focus naturally in air, so without an airspace in front of your eyes, things will look fuzzy underwater. The airspace provided by a mask restores clarity (and if you normally wear eyeglasses, many dive masks are available with prescription lenses).

                Masks provide a pocket through which you can squeeze your nose shut with your fingers. Why would you want to do that? Because the easiest way to equalize (or “clear”) your ears is to be able to squeeze your nostrils closed and fill the airspace in your ears by gently blowing against the closed nostrils. This “pushes” air from your lungs into airspace in the ears, just like equalizing your ears when you’re driving at altitude or flying. After you’ve been diving for a while, you’ll probably become adept at clearing your ears without even touching your nose. But during the first few dives of the season, or if you’re even the slightest bit congested, you’ll want to be able to squeeze your nose shut, and a flexible nose pocket is necessary to allow you to do that. For that reason, choose a mask design that provides easy access to gently pinching your nose.

                Masks provide a means of equalizing pressure and expelling collected water. Many non-divers assume that the reason a dive mask encloses the nose, as well as the eyes, is to keep water out of your nose and negate any need for a nose clip. Masks designs certainly do this, but that’s not the real reason your nose in contained in your mask – it’s just a handy side benefit. The real reason for having a mask that encloses your nose is so you can exhale through your nose into the mask space, adding air to equalize the air pressure within the mask to match the hydrostatic pressure of the water pushing against the mask from the outside. If you couldn’t do this, the mask would quickly develop “squeeze” and grow uncomfortable as you went deeper. In addition, if water gets in and accumulates in the bottom of your mask, you’ll want to be able to clear it out easily. With most masks, you simply exhale through the nose while tilting the mask slightly so the water gets pushed out past the flexible skirt edge at the bottom of the mask. Some masks incorporate a one-way purge valve in the mask’s bottom; with these, you don’t even need to touch the mask to clear it. You just tilt your head so the purge is at the mask’s lowest point, exhale through your nose, and the water all drains out of the purge valve.
