                Simply put, a scuba regulator is the device that delivers air to the diver and lets the diver breathe underwater. All regulators sold in professional dive centers today are reliable, and many have fantastic added features that make diving easier and more fun.
                Regulators deliver air to the diver by using two separate “stages” to reduce the high pressure of the air from the tank. Both stages working together make it possible for the diver to get air delivered at a pressure that is comfortable for breathing.  Most modern regulators are of a “single hose” design, so-called because a single hose is used to move air from the scuba tank to the diver’s mouth, allowing them to breathe easily. The air moves first through a regulator first stage which is attached to the scuba tank, into the regulator’s second stage, which is the part through which the diver breathes. The second stage has a comfortable mouthpiece attached allowing the diver to breathe from it easily.

                If you look at them in cutaway drawings regulators may seem technical and complicated, but all modern first and second stages are actually very sound and straightforward devices, specifically designed to be tough and trustworthy.

            <h3>Here’s how the basic regulator works:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        When you breathe in on the second stage, you create a drop in pressure inside the body of the second stage. This causes a specially-designed silicone rubber diaphragm to move inward (sort of like when you inhale on a plastic soda bottle and the sides move inward). The diaphragm contacts a lever attached to a small valve which rocks open, allowing air to enter the mouthpiece. If you only breathe in a little, the diaphragm only moves a little, and just a little air is released. But if you inhale forcefully, the diaphragm and lever move farther, giving you a larger volume of air. As the air in the hose feeding the second stage is at an “intermediate pressure” of around 140 pounds per square inch (PSI), the amount of reserve air available is still formidable: with some regulators you can “purge” the second stage by pushing in on the diaphragm and ruffle somebody’s hair across the room! So suffice it to say that the air available at any one time will be greater than what you could ever use in a typical diving situation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first stage, which is located between the scuba tank valve and the hose feeding the second stage, is responsible for taking the high-pressure air coming out of the tank and reducing it to the 140 PSI or so intermediate pressure that the second stage needs to function properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One thing all modern regulators have in common is dependability. They are built to stringent quality standards and they are designed in such a way as to always provide air to the diver, as long as there is air in the scuba tank. Even if there is a problem with the regulator underwater due to lack of yearly maintenance, the regulator will still deliver air to the diver, though it may “freeflow,” and use up the air in the tank quickly.
