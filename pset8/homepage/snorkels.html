                A snorkel seems simple enough – essentially, it’s a tube that you use to draw air from the surface while your face is in the water.

                But there are more variables than might first occur to you. The size of the bore (tube) of the snorkel is important. It has to be large enough for you to take a deep breath quickly and easily, but not so large that it adds unnecessarily to the volume of air you must move back and forth on each breath.
                <br><br>
                The length of the snorkel is also important. It has to be long enough to stay above the surface while you swim, float, or otherwise rest or work at the surface. But too long a snorkel can be awkward, and can actually be harder from which to breathe.

                Gear manufacturers are more than familiar with all of these factors, as well as the ergonomics that make a snorkel comfortable to use. So if you choose a reputable brand from your professional dive retailer, you can rest assured you’ll get a solid piece of essential dive gear that works well.            </p>
